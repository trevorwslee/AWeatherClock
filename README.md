# Arduino Weather Clock -- `AWeatherClock` -- v1.0


![](imgs/awc.png)

This [little microcontroller project](https://github.com/trevorwslee/AWeatherClock) `AWeatherClock` (Arduino Weather Clock) was inspired by [pyClock](https://github.com/01studio-lab/pyClock),
and is implemented using the Arduino framework.

VSCode with PlatformIO extension is the primarily development environment for the project, in the similar fashion as described by the post -- [A Way to Run Arduino Sketch With VSCode PlatformIO Directly](https://www.instructables.com/A-Way-to-Run-Arduino-Sketch-With-VSCode-PlatformIO/) 

|  |  |
|--|--|
|Naturally, the hardware used for the initial development of the project was exactly the one mention in the `pyClock` GitHub repository.|<div style='width:250px;height:250px'>![](imgs/pyclock_main_00.jpg)</div>|

Nevertheless, the sketch of `AWeatherClock` should be adaptable to other hardware configurations, with a big enough colored TFT LCD screen.

The functions of `AWeatherClock` are:
* Display of a digital clock synchronized with NTP
* Display of the current weather info gathered from [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/) with ***version 2.5*** APIs [for [free account](https://openweathermap.org/full-price#onecall)]
* Alarms
* Idle slideshow of photos (JPEG images) uploaded to the MCU, much like the slideshow function as described by  [Simple Arduino Framework Raspberry Pi Pico / ESP32 TFT LCD Photo Frame Implementation With Photos Downloaded From the Internet Via DumbDisplay](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Arduino-Framework-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-ESP32-T/)

`AWeatherClock` requires hardware with the following capabilities:
* ESP32 line of MCU that supports WiFi, or Raspberry Pi PicoW
* 240x240 (or bigger) colored TFT LCD screen
* Able to provide with simple "trigger" input, like with
  - `BUTTON`
  - `TOUCH SCREEN`
* Optionally -- buzzer, speaker or audio module (like ES8311 for ESP32) -- for sounding of alarms.

Since `AWeatherClock` needs to gather current weather info from [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up),
please, sign up for an `APP_ID` of their ***version 2.5*** APIs. 
You will need this `APP_ID` in order to setup for `AWeatherClock` -- please refer to the section [Basic Hardcoded Configurations](#basic-hardcoded-configurations----configh)

Also, [DumbDisplay Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nobody.trevorlee.dumbdisplay)
for Android phone is an essential part of `AWeatherClock` since most settings -- including alarm setups and slideshow photos upload -- can be done with remote UI realized on your Android phone 
with the help of DumbDisplay Android app
* Photos to upload can be acquired in the following ways:
  - randomly from the Internet
    * [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/)
    * [loremflickr.com](https://loremflickr.com/#google_vignette)
    * [placedog.net](https://placedog.net/)
  - randomly from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)
    * for downloading photos from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/), you will need to [sign up](https://unsplash.com/developers) and create a demo app for an `Access Key` 
  - pick from your phone
  - take with your phone's camera  
* Location for weather info
  - according to hardcode query string (`DEF_OPEN_WEATHER_API_LOCATION` defined in `config.h`), or
  - based on GPS location of your phone queried via DumbDisplay Android app  
* NTP timezone
  - the initial timezone of your MCU is hardcoded to the macro `INIT_TIMEZONE` defined in `config.h`
  - after weather info gathering, timezone of your MCU is set to the timezone returned
* When connected to DumbDisplay Android app, `AWeatherClock` is considered not idle, and hence slideshow will not start      

Notice that the remote UI on your Android phone is driven by the sketch -- i.e. the control flow of the UI is programmed in the sketch -- hence, other than the DumbDisplay Android app, there is no specific mobile app for `AWeatherClock`.

  - it's touch screen is configured as a `TOUCH SCREEN` for "trigger" input 
  - a speaker is attached to it -- one end of the speaker is connected to `GND` and the other end is connected to `GP15`

Note for TWatch (`TW3`): If when compile you see some "include font" error, it might be that the project's folder path is too long.
In such a case, try move the project to somewhere closer to the "root" of your filesystem 

# Showing of IP

With `BUTTON` or `TOUCH SCREEN`, you can trigger `AWeatherClock` to show the IP of your MCU to connect to with your Android DumbDisplay app

|  |  |
|--|--|
|Be the "trigger" mechanism `BUTTON` or `TOUCH SCREEN`, you "double click" to trigger showing of IP|<div style='width:250px;height:250px'>![](imgs/ast_watch_ip_00.jpg)</div>|


# Settings UI 

As mentioned previously, most of the `AWeatherClock` settings can be modified with the UI remotely rendered on your Android phone with DumbDisplay Android app


# Settings UI -- General

|  |  |
|--|--|
|With the `General` tab, you can modify the general settings / options|<div style='width:400px;height:600px'>![](imgs/tab_general_00.jpg)</div>|

* `üå§Ô∏è` -- you click the `üå§Ô∏è` button to trigger refresh of the current weather info
* `12 Hour` / `24 Hour` -- you select whether the digital clock display should be in 12-hour or 24-hour format
* `üì°` -- you select whether to sync weather location with the GPS location of your phone
* `Slide Show Idle` -- you select the idle time (in minutes) before starting slideshow
* `Slide Duration` -- you select the duration (in seconds) each slide should be kept shown, before switching to another one
* `Update Weather` -- you select the gap (in minutes) between each auto update of the current weather info


# Settings UI -- Alarms

|  |  |
|--|--|
|With the `Alarms` tab, you can set up the alarms of `AWeatherClock`|<div style='width:400px;height:600px'>![](imgs/tab_alarm_00.jpg)</div>|

* The `üï∞Ô∏è` icon next to an alarm indicates that the alarm is ON; below that icon, the time of the alarm is shown, like `00:00`
* You can select any one of the alarms to edit. The details of the alarm being edited are shown on the right-side
  - you can turn the alarm ON / OFF by selecting the `‚è∞` button
  - you select the `üîÑ` button to set that the alarm is to be repeated daily; and the week days for the repeat are indicated by the
    `Su` / `Mo` / `Tu` / `We` / `Th` / `Fr` / `Sa` below the `üîÑ` button
  - The time of the alarm is clearly shown further down below. You can press the `üîº` / `üîΩ` to have the alarm hour / minute changed. Alternatively, you can double-press 
    on the hour / minute to have a pop-up dialog for you to enter the hour / minute of the alarm.
    Note that if you enter a value bigger than 99, like 1230, it will be interpreted as the time 12:30   


# Settings UI -- Slides

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
|![](imgs/tab_slides_00.jpg)|![](imgs/tab_slides_01.jpg)|![](imgs/tab_slides_02.jpg)|


With the `Slides` tab, you can add / remove photos for the idle slideshow
* `‚¨ÖÔ∏è` / `‚û°Ô∏è` -- you use the `‚¨ÖÔ∏è` / `‚û°Ô∏è` buttons to review the slideshow photos
  - you select the photo to be deleted from the slideshow
  - newly uploaded photo can be saved to the slideshow after the photo selected
* `üíæ` / `üóëÔ∏è` -- you delete the photo shown by double-pressing `üóëÔ∏è`; the `üíæ` is for you to add the uploaded photo to the slideshow
* Acquire photo to upload:
  - `üåç` / `üí¶` -- you trigger download of a random photo from the Internet by pressing `üåç`; `üí¶` is specifically for downloading a random photo from Unsplash     
  - `üì±` / `üì∑` -- you pick a photo from your phone by pressing `üì±`; you take a photo with your phone's camera by pressing `üì∑`
  - In any case, the uploaded photo will be considered "unsaved"; you press `üíæ` to add the photo to the slideshow
  - Also notice for photo that might not fit `AWeatherClock` screen, a [crop UI](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop) will be invoked for you to crop the photo in order to fit the screen 
  

# Basic Hardcoded Configurations -- `config.h`

`config.h` for secrets like `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD` and `OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_APP_ID`
```
...
// #####
// # you will need to either
// # . enable and complete the following "secret" block
// # . or create and complete the "secret" block in the file `_secret.h`
// #####
#if false

  // ----------------------
  // !!! "secret" block !!!
  // ----------------------
  //
  // *****
  // * you can setup WIFI_SSID / WIFI_PASSWORD; for ESP32, if WIFI_SSID not defined, will use WiFiManager to get WiFi SSID and password
  // * you will need to setup OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_APP_ID
  // * you can optionally setup UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID
  // *****

  #define WIFI_SSID               "<wifi ssid>"
  #define WIFI_PASSWORD           "<wifi password>"

  // you MUST get APP_ID from https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
  #define OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_APP_ID "<app id>"

  // optionally, sign up and create an app to get Access Key from https://unsplash.com/developers
  // comment out UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID if you do not want to use unsplash.com
  #define UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID      "<client id>"

#else
  #include "_secret.h"
#endif  
...
```
Notes:
* For ESP32 line of MCU, it is not a must to define `WIFI_SSID` / `WIFI_PASSWORD`. In case not defined, [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) will be used to acquire the WiFi credential. Say, you connect to the AP set up by WiFiManager running on your MCU, with AP name `AWClock`, as defined by `AUTOCONNECT_AP_NAME` in `config.h`
* However, you ***MUST*** set your own `OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_APP_ID` for ***version 2.5*** APIs which you can apply for from [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up),
  say with a [free account](https://openweathermap.org/full-price#onecall)
* Optionally, you can sign up and create an app to get Access Key from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers); with `UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID` defined,
  your are ready to download photos from Unsplash and upload them to your MCU for slideshow


`config.h` for other basic hardcoded configurations
```
...
// TIMEZONE (in hours); note that NTP timezone will be gotten from weather api, hence, this is just the initial TIMEZONE
#define INIT_TIMEZONE                       8

// In order to properly setup the openweathermap.org the endpoint
// * please head to http://api.openweathermap.org to create an account and get an APP ID (for version 2.5) 
// * the country (location) for which to retrieve whether is defined with OPEN_WEATHER_API_LOCATION
//   - please refer to https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api
//   - Please use ISO 3166 country codes -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes
// * below DEF_SYNC_WEATHER_LOCATION_WITH_GPS ==> got location from GPS when connected to DD
#define DEF_OPEN_WEATHER_API_LOCATION       "Hong Kong"

#define DEF_SYNC_WEATHER_LOCATION_WITH_GPS  true /* got location from GPS when connected to DD */
#define DEF_SLIDE_SHOW_IDLE_DELAY_MINS      2    /* <= 0 means slide show not enabled */
#define DEF_SLIDE_DURATION_SECS             5
#define DEF_UPDATE_WEATHER_INT_MINS         30

#define NUM_ALARMS                          5
#define AUTO_ACK_ALARM_MINUTES              10
...
```
Notes:
* `INIT_TIMEZONE` -- the initial timezone; as mentioned previously; your MCU's timezone will eventually sync with that returned from 'get current weather' API 
* `DEF_OPEN_WEATHER_API_LOCATION` -- the location (see [ISO 3166 country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes))
  for the initial current weather info; note that when connected to DumbDisplay Android app, your phone's GPS location can be the
  location for getting current weather info
* `DEF_SYNC_WEATHER_LOCATION_WITH_GPS` -- The default setting whether "get current weather" should be based on GPS location got from your phone,
  (rather than based on `DEF_OPEN_WEATHER_API_LOCATION`)
* `DEF_SLIDE_SHOW_IDLE_DELAY_MINS` -- The default setting for how many idle minutes to start slideshow  
* `DEF_SLIDE_DURATION_SECS` -- The default setting for how many seconds for each slideshow phone should stay displayed before switching to another one
* `DEF_UPDATE_WEATHER_INT_MINS` -- The default setting for the interval (minutes) between each update of current weather info
* `NUM_ALARMS` -- The fixed number of alarms `AWeatherClock` can set
* `AUTO_ACK_ALARM_MINUTES` -- The number of minutes before due alarm is automatically acknowledged (stopped)


# System Hardcoded Configurations -- `sys_config.h`

The system hardcoded configuration file `sys_config.h` not only contains most hardware pin mappings (as will be mentioned in the next section 
[Highlight for Customization for New Hardware](#highlight-for-customization-for-new-hardware));
specifically, `sys_config.h` contains some values that will be useful during development:
```
...
// comment out to DEBUG use of WIFI MANAGER for WiFi SSID / password
//#define TEST_WIFI_MANAGER

// comment out if you want the program to delay startup for 10 seconds for debugging (examine the serial monitor output)
//#define DELAY_INITIALIZE_FOR_SECONDS 10

// suggested to set the following EEPROM_HEADER to the date you want to reset the saved program settings *** INCLUDING saved slides ***
const int32_t EEPROM_HEADER = 20250505;
...
```


#  Customizations for New Hardware Highlights 

There are several areas to consider for customizing `AWeatherClock` for new hardware:
* TFT LCD screen; the out-of-the-box configured TFT LCD screens are
  - ST7789 with [Adafruit ST7735 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library.git)
  - LCD Screen of TWatch (`TW3`)
* Button or touch screen; the out-of-the-box configured touch screens are
  - FT6336U with [Arduino FT6336U](https://github.com/aselectroworks/Arduino-FT6336U)
  - CST816T with [cst816t](https://github.com/koendv/cst816t)
* Buzzer or audio module; the out-of-the-box configured audio module is
  - ES8311 with [arduino audio driver](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-driver) and [arduino audio tools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools)

As mentioned previously, the pin mappings are mostly defined in `sys_config.h`

For example, for `PYCLOCK`, which has a button
```
  #define TFT_CS          5
  #define TFT_DC          4
  #define TFT_SCLK        6
  #define TFT_MOSI        7
  #define TFT_RST         8
  #define TFT_X_OFF       0
  #define BUTTON_PIN      9
```
Notes:
* `TFT_xxx` -- the pin mappings for the TFT LCD screen
* `TFT_X_OFF` -- the x offset to start the 240x240 area; note that the TFT screen can actually be wider than 240
* `BUTTON_PIN` -- the pin number of the button; assume it is `INPUT_PULLUP`

In case of CST816T touch screen, like that for `AST_WATCH`
```
  #define TFT_CS          3
  #define TFT_DC          2
  #define TFT_SCLK        5
  #define TFT_MOSI        6
  #define TFT_RST         8
  #define TFT_X_OFF       20
  #define CST_TP_BUS_NUM  0
  #define CST_TP_SCL      7
  #define CST_TP_SDA      11
  #define CST_TP_RST      10
  #define CST_TP_INT      9
  #define BUZZER_PIN      1
```
* `TFT_xxx` -- the pin mappings for the TFT LCD screen
* `TFT_X_OFF` -- x offset is to 20, since the TFT LCD screen is 280x240
* `CST_TP_xxx` -- the pin mappings for the CST816T touch layer
* `BUZZER_PIN` -- the pin number of the buzzer

Nevertheless, especially for TFT LCD screen, simply define the pin mapping normally not good enough.
Indeed, you will need other customizations to the code, like initialization of `Adafruit_ST7789` object in `screen_helpers.cpp`
```
...
#if defined(FOR_PYCLOCK)
  #include <Adafruit_ST7789.h>
  SPIClass spi(FSPI);
  Adafruit_ST7789 tft(&spi, TFT_CS, TFT_DC, TFT_RST);
#elif defined(FOR_AST_WATCH)
  #include <Adafruit_ST7789.h>
  SPIClass spi(FSPI);
  Adafruit_ST7789 tft(&spi, TFT_CS, TFT_DC, TFT_RST);
#elif defined(FOR_PICOW_GP)
  #include <Adafruit_ST7789.h>
  Adafruit_ST7789 tft(&SPI1, TFT_CS, TFT_DC, TFT_RST);
#elif defined(FOR_PICOW)
  #include <Adafruit_ST7789.h>
  Adafruit_ST7789 tft(TFT_CS, TFT_DC, TFT_RST);
...
...
void screenSetup() {
#if defined(FOR_PYCLOCK)
  spi.begin(TFT_SCLK, -1, TFT_MOSI, TFT_CS);
  tft.init(240, 240, SPI_MODE0);
  tft.invertDisplay(true);
  tft.setRotation(2);
  tft.setSPISpeed(40000000);
#elif defined(FOR_AST_WATCH)  
  spi.begin(TFT_SCLK, -1, TFT_MOSI, TFT_CS);
  tft.init(240, 280, SPI_MODE0);
  tft.setRotation(3);
#elif defined(FOR_PICOW_GP)  
  pinMode(TFT_BL, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(TFT_BL, 1);  // light it up
  SPI1.setSCK(TFT_SCLK);
  SPI1.setMOSI(TFT_MOSI);
  tft.init(240, 240, SPI_MODE0);
  tft.setRotation(3);
#elif defined(FOR_PICOW)  
  pinMode(TFT_BL, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(TFT_BL, 1);  // light it up
  tft.init(240, 320, SPI_MODE0);
  tft.setRotation(1);
  tft.setSPISpeed(40000000);
  ...
}
...
```

Normally, customizing for `BUTTON` or `TOUCH SCREEN` code modifications should be easier, like in `trigger_helpers.cpp`:
```
...
#if defined(CST_TP_BUS_NUM)
  #include <Wire.h>
  #include "cst816t.h"
  TwoWire tpWire(CST_TP_BUS_NUM);
  cst816t touchpad(tpWire, CST_TP_RST, CST_TP_INT);
#elif defined(FT_TP_SCL)
  #include <Wire.h>
  #include "FT6336U.h"
  FT6336U touchpad(/*FT_TP_SDA, FT_TP_SCL, */FT_TP_RST, FT_TP_INT);
#elif defined(GT911_TP_SCL)  
  #include "TAMC_GT911.h"
  TAMC_GT911 touchpad = TAMC_GT911(GT911_TP_SDA, GT911_TP_SCL, GT911_TP_INT, GT911_TP_RST, GT911_TP_WIDTH, GT911_TP_HEIGHT);
...
void triggerSetup() {
#ifdef BUTTON_PIN
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);  // assume INPUT_PULLUP
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(BUTTON_PIN), _triggered, FALLING);
#elif defined(TOUCH_PIN)
  touchAttachInterrupt(TOUCH_PIN, _triggered, TOUCH_THRESHOLD);
#elif defined(CST_TP_BUS_NUM)
  tpWire.begin(CST_TP_SDA, CST_TP_SCL);
  touchpad.begin(mode_motion);
#elif defined(FT_TP_SCL)
  Wire.setSDA(FT_TP_SDA);            // FT6336U will use Wire
  Wire.setSCL(FT_TP_SCL);
  touchpad.begin();
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(FT_TP_INT), _triggered, CHANGE);
  ...
}
...
```
